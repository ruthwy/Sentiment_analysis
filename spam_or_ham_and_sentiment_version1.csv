An elevated highway might be cheaper to build but would likely be more expensive to maintain - especially during the winter. Some kind of steam heating built underneath the road would be needed to stop snow accumulation.

2) and leaving out the expensive high maintenance car pods and let the autonomous cars drive alone in the tunnels on the correct paths would also be better.",ham,neutral

"Understand this to all of you Elon Mush followers. EL ON, is an imposter on Our Planet and he is 
doing more harm to Our Planet and Atmosphere than you may think; with his revolutionary ideas. He is nothing but a South African Foreign Immigrant Boy Genius, that made his way into the USA through Canada, then by way of California. EL ON steals Our Tax Dollars by way of Grant Money from Our Own USA Government, which should go to USA Native Geniuses. No, instead Our Own USA Government gives this False Icon known as EL ON Musk the financial backing to pollute Our Earth with his Lithium Batteries and pollute Our Atmosphere with his Rockets and much other Space Debris. Now he plans to pollute Our Atmosphere even more with his Starlink Enterprise, which will cause a number of collisions with other Satellites in Space, causing more Space Junk and more Collisions. Who gave this EL ON a pass to pollute Our World and Atmosphere? The USA / State Government? News Flash, the Governments are there to Serve The People and We pay Our Taxes so the Governments can give EL ON more Grants and State Incentives to pollute Our World and Atmosphere. ¬†This EL ON is an imposter sent to drain and deplete Our Planet and he is helping the Droconians find a new home in the next Planet over, Mars, so that they may Industrialize Mars too. Don't believe his hype. He only develops prototypes for his projects or Low Scale Developments of his ideas to a Minimum Point, so it is enough to get Investors and Grant Money. Or just to get Future Seekers, like me, following this Imposter. Our Future Generations are going to pay for the mess that EL ON has made here. By the way, if you think the ""Boring Company,"" is just another cute little name EL ON came up with; NO, the word ""Bor,"" means ""Drill,"" in the Dutch Language. That is exactly what the ""Boring Company,"" is doing; ""Drilling."" Under the Major Cities of the USA. There is something else going On here with EL ON. EL ON is from South Africa, but We All know the Dutch Settled in South Africa and created a Mass Apartiehd System, of Segregation, Hate, and Genocide on the Darker Peoples of South Africa. ¬†The Dutch created one of the most Ruthless and Shameful Acts of Racism in Our Most Recent History. That same Dutch Mentality and Blood is in the Vessels of this Boy Genius, EL ON, that Everyone is praising today. The USA Government allows a Dutch / South African / Canadian / USA Alien Foreign Immigrant to come to Our Country and dig up under the streets in Our Major Cities in the name of getting from Point A to Point B faster, and he does his Ventures with USA Government Funding. What a Fu@kin joke. You People better wake up. EL ON is a master salesman and a golden boy for Future Seekers that want the latest gadgets for their garages. This is why he; sta, sta, sta, studders his words so much, because most of his words and prototypes will never come to fruition, and some are just lies. Last point: Why do I call him EL ON? Well, you know that all of the Biblical Arch Angels (Nephilims) have the EL on their last names (Micha'EL, Gabri'EL, Ari'EL, Isra'EL, etc.); and ON was an Ancient Demi-God of the Mesopotamian¬†Era. EL ON is representing himself as this genius that We have started to worship as some sort of a Demi-God. I am kind of stuck on what to think about this EL ON now. I will keep track of his so-called progress and then make a determination.",spam,negative

"Doomed to failure, and the animation does not even closely resemble the sewer pipe they drove the Tesla in a couple months back.
The number of vehicles able to traverse this system is limited to the number of skates. The number of skates is limited to the number of parking spaces collectively used. When you enter the system you have rely on a skate being present. When you exit the system, you have to pray there is no skate in the stall you want to leave through. If you have more skates in the system than parking spaces, it is theoretically possible to have all the spaces occupied and nowhere available to exit the system.
Musk's vapid comments about being able to ""drill down indefinitely to create levels upon levels of tunnels"" should also clue most people in to the fact that he has NO clue. How does your skate get to the third level or 12th level of tunnels without encountering the others above it, how do you get from one level to the next, how do those tunnels converge at the terminus? How do you extract cars that wreck, catch fire (as Teslas do). And how are you expected to travel at hundreds of mph when your Tesla has no such top speed? In the LA sewer tunnel prototype, the heavily modified Tesla used its own motor to traverse the tunnel, and at a minimal top speed to boot. 300mph?  Pfft!
Let's say the skates actually were able to do 300mph. The car's suspension is not built for that. How is the skate going to attach itself to the vehicle? Wheel hubs, perhaps? Well, THEY'RE not built for that acceleration/deceleration either. And the safety features/airbags/crumple zones are ALSO not built to withstand accidents at 300mph. Also, whiplash much?

He is especially fond of fast-tracking, which illustrates his lack of wisdom.  There is absolutely no reason to construct the very restricted means of transport he is pushing.

Is there a huge gaping hole in the street, some moron drives their car on top of you?  Also, what if someone decides to drive their car off the trolley in the tunnel, and causes an incident where the trolleys shut down, how do you get emergency responders to the scene?

"driving in nyc, whole new lanes (and roads) needed to deal with the 'elevator' spaces needed to get to the tunnels...
 which must be much deeper than subways even or you have tremendous structural problems with not only the weight of skyscrapers above, but subway tunnels, sewers piping, internet, gas, electric infrastructure, and people (not an unsubstantial weight, considering rush hour, buses, cars). Now build some elevators exactly matching up with street level going down to your boing tunnels, and those tunnels may not cause any higher structure to falter... and the elevators and lanes you want to co-opt can't cause traffic issues. this is still a pipe dream. the only way this can work is when a new city is expanding, and doesn't have the whole pop density/infrastructure density that la, chicago, ny has. they should be trying in this in smaller up and coming cities with higher elevation and nowhere near fault lines.",ham,neutral

From a structural safety standpoint, the tunnel moves uniformly with the ground, in contrast to surface structures.  Additionally, a large amount of earthquake damage occurs from falling debris, which does not apply inside tunnels. Some examples:
    1994 Northridge Earthquake: no damage to LA Subway tunnels
    1989 Loma Prieta (Northern California) Earthquake: no damage to tunnels, which were then used to transport rescue personnel
    1985 Mexico City Earthquake: no damage to tunnels, which were then used to transport rescue personnel""

Then the rail zaps them to their destination. But the cars still run on their regular tyres. Just that they don't control their speed and turns.Futuristic Solution: Electric car enters tunnel, controls get overridden, car speed set to Xkm/hr. So it's like a speed lane where all cars move at a constant set speedICE cars get latched to the rail. EVs get command to set speed to that of the tunnel. Problem solved",ham,neutral

 cars pulled onto wider sleds with multiple slots at specific areas of the city. I mean if the subway was just a bunch of benchs that transported two people at once it would be chaotic and very dangerous in the tunnel especially if something went. There would just be too much engineering involved, and end up being very expensive and too extension too manage. If there were lots of areas (but not nearly as many that the parking spot sized elevator would require) basically just the size of a medium sized parking lot where cars can get in line and pull into a slot on a sled and then take off together, maybe 5 per sled, I think it could work better. It would also would most likely be more cost efficient..",ham,positive

Who needs ""mass transit"" and those silly things called ""subways"", you can't take your car on one, so its so stupid an idea!Seems like every genius engineer has to have a Spruce Goose - it might work, but, in the long run, its expensive, and unnecessary, as well as an episode of time when they strip naked and store their pee in a jar, which would be Elon Musk's obsession with the ideas that something which we may never see for another 200 years, but he is *sure* we will have magically breakthroughs over, any day now (never mind that we don't even have a clue how the F to find those breakthroughs), will somehow pit uploaded/neuralinked transhumans against a malignant child of Siri (presumably without both being reduced to ineffectual idiocy by our poor understanding of sentience, consciousness and actual function of critical bits of the brain's function).Its all well and good to dwell on the grand ideas, and possible risks, of freaking science fiction, but not to the bloody stupid extent that you make the same mistake past writers did, and start thinking that, ""2020 sounds like a good date to pick for when it will all happen."", or the even bloody worse nonsense of assuming that, just because you can imagine something, the ""end result"" will ""look like, and function exactly like"", what you are imagining. Hint: it never does, and sometime, fear, lack of openness in the design process, etc. make it so that, even if it was vaguely ""possible"" to get a result, it will either be supplanted by something else, with its own limitations and problems, or it will never, ever, result in the exact form you imagined. What ever bits of the silly nonsense Musk keeps rambling about that do happen, they will look **nothing at all** like what he, or any of the other squirrely, semi-paranoid, ""visionaries"" imagine it will, unless, ironically, someone 50-100 years after the ""real one"" comes along decides to create a ""retro"" version. A sort of ""Fallout game"" equivalent of, ""What if we actually had all those crazy breakthroughs back in 2020, when the world looked so backwards and had so many silly idea?""Much of the stuff he comes up with, like every generation of ""visionaries"", is silly and absurd, even to the people living in it. Because, again... WTF good is it to take the existing problem, i.e., lack of public transportation, and/or sensible solutions to move people around, and shove all that into single vehicle, underground, and overly bloody complicated, ""single car transporters, which, when things f up, will leave you stuck down there, or misqueue and shove your car up under someone else on the road up top (or possibly open the hole in front of the car already there, or.. Good design means, ""Fewer things that can go wrong."", not, ""Heh, I think Rube Goldberg had a great solution to our traffic problem, here is how I would implement it!!"" Yikes! And the cost of doing it the stupid way, instead of just... firing all the idiots that keep stealing money from things like California's transit system (which would, sadly, be most of the politicians in the state), and actually building a light rail system for people... Mind, just to be clear on this - this is proof that Democrats, while they may be pro-social issues, are still conservative/greed driven on every other subject, and thus **not actually progressives**. The idiots in charge in other cities, including mine, which is conservative run, and in Arizona, pull the same thing, on the same issues. They recently killed public transportation (because, well, when no one, because of how the city is laid out, in part, can ""get"" to the damn bus, its kind of silly to whine about there being no one riding them), but, while they where still trying to fund it, they had a small.. hickup. Seems, millions went ""missing"", which where supposed to be allocated to the project. They, surprisingly, ""found"" enough millions, misallocated to other projects, to fix this, but ""never"" managed to work out how, whoops!, it went missing in the first place. I mean, seriously? When they can't f-ing keep track of where money went/got spent in **either** Republican or Democrat run cities/states, is it any wonder why both sides have some completely delusional ideas about how the economy works, with the former thinking that it all ""fixes itself, via market forces"", while the latter seems to think it just grows on trees?
Sorry about that bit of rant, but.. seriously, you can't, ""Do what is needed to elevate people above the problems they can't solve themselves."", by ""hoping"" the money will magically appear when needed, instead of.. actually planning out how to spend it sensibly (the Democrat's problem), nor by just going, ""Well, gosh... we have no idea where it went, but those people are not trying hard enough to fix their own problems anyway, so why worry? The market will fix everything, and I have this spendy project that will help the market coming up, so I need to cut something from children's food programs to pay for it!"" (the Republican solution). Where the F are the people, who we can vote for, that believe in a) actual accounting for the money, and b) actually making sure the freaking solutions ""fix"" the actual problems, instead of just wishing they fix themselves, or praying the money will drop out of the sky, to fund something they don't actually pay enough attention to for them to know if its working, or not, or why not?

"You people are giving musk too much credit for figuring stuff out. I pretty much guarantee the finances and engineering HAVENT been thouroghly looked at considering the hypothetical nature of this project. 

Even so, the likelihood is that musk's ""super secret improved tunneling method"" is a load of bullshit. Maybe we can reduce costs by 10-15%? Well on a 500 mil dollar tunnel, even with 15% cost reduction you are still paying 425 mil a tunnel.

How much will you be charged for the tunnel? At $5 (a ridiculously high toll) per car per entrance, it would take 85 million cars to pay off a single tunnel.

The initial price of tunnel is probably off, but the concept stays the same. There is no financially feasible way to install a tunnel infrastructure, especially under an active city like New York or Seattle. That's why places like Seattle have above road rails. It's much more economically feasible to not have to dig everything first.",spam,negative

It looks to me as though this is intended for interstate travel. Look at the velocity figures presented in the animation. Very similar numbers to that of the bullet train in japan, which is primarily used to travel city to city over lengthy distances. I see a similar use here, a faster, safer, and more energy efficient alternative to interstate highways. It also has a leg up on air travel because once you arrive at your destination, you still have the comforts of your own vehicle to get around. In addition, it would be a great response to critics of Tesla vehicles who say that their range is an obstacle for travel over long distances because this could eliminate the need for constant refueling/recharging stops throughout the journey.

be a subway line within walking distance of everything important in an

problem. From an urban planning perspective, a car-free or car-lite 
streetscape is much healthier for pedestrians, and in turn better for

"Would they even need the ""docking car"" or whatever they call it for self driving cars? I get that it might be beneficial for gasoline cars 
because of the exhaust problem. But this would totaly be doable without the need for a tunnel with self driving cars on a road, you just can't mix them with normal drivers. Only beneficial thing is that this removes traffic from the roads but if you had self driving cars that goes over 200 km/h on the road with no human errors there would be no congestions on the high ways",ham,neutral

"Looks like its a slightly larger version of the Tesla skateboard car base.  Four wheels with battery pack.  Way easier to make than a model S
 or even a model 3.  The lifts are generic leveraging mass production.  The main thing that makes it look impractical is the speed that suitable tunnels could be built.   But if they can nail that speed increase for tunnelling then... Yeah... Maybe.   Certainly less legal issues underground.  It could also be quite scalable and testable so long as you have a tunnelling machine and a team of ninjaneers.  Very crazy at first glance though.",spam,neutral

"Why not completely discard the idea of personal vehicles and focus on public transport? I do not know other people, but I only have a car to move to places, not because I like to have it (in fact I would not have a car, it's a very expensive expense).

Simply set up an automated network of buses and cars that comes close to picking up people on request and taking them to their destination. It's not such a crazy idea if you think about it.

The automation of travel and communication between vehicles to improve traffic (at the level that traffic lights are no longer needed, for example, thus reducing travel time) is something that is already being done (and I think Tesla also works on something similar). After the success of services such as BlaBlaCar or Uber (leaving aside the nefarious news that the latter company raises) shows that society is prepared for it.

And by God, it will probably be so efficient that with 10% of the current traffic is enough to cover the displacement needs of the population.

Unfortunately I think that's the true science fiction. I very much doubt that the motoring lobbies are in favor of this. In fact this was already prevented at the time. Https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy",spam,neutral

Then, it doesn't even show a secure way to fasten the car to the cart. This video completely forgets about momentum and intertia. What happens if two carts crash? It looks like there is no AI on these mindless carts to compensate for extrenuous situations, they are just carts on underground rails. The amount of funding, equipment, and workers you would need for such an immense projects makes it not even worth it, especially if it still needs at least a decade to even happen.
